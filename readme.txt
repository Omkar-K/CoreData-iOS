The task was to develop an iPhone CoreData App to manage your friends data. 
The app was successfully tested on Xcode Version 11.3.1

I have successfully created and tested the app with all the requirements.
UIImagePicker is implemented successfully. 

Additional Technical contribution:
• Added a Search function for the list. It is available in the table view. A custom make request function was used. 
• Added a splash screen when opening the app. 
• Changed the default icon of the app.
• Added an edit button to conveniently delete cells. 
• The label of the second screen changes depending if you add new data or update existing data.
